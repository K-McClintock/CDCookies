### Introduction
This project is a fake cookie website from a fake brand, in the vein of President's Choice and Sam's Choice products. I had planned a whole line of fake products and sub-brands, but the first one was always chocolate chip cookies. It uses the Cookie ipsum generator I wrote for the ad copy. I designed the logo (center cookie in the navbar) as well.


### Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* JavaScript/ECMAScript 6
* Procreate/Photoshop


### Project Status
This project is still ongoing, as I refine the code to clean it up and improve efficiency.
